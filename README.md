## 🖖 Live-Long-and-Ship

A small collection of tools, toys, and experiments — built for curiosity, shipped for fun.

A personal engineering bay, a shuttlecraft bay, and occasionally a holodeck —  
somewhere between a Teyvat workshop, a Herta Space Station lab,  
and a Random Play backroom full of things that simply deserved to exist.

**Half serious. Fully shipped.**  
If it compiles, it ships.  
**Live long. Ship often. 🖖**
